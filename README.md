# Haiku Generator

### Node, Jquery and Javascript Exercise for Epicodus, 03/15/2018
### By Tyler Kostelak

## Description
_This project is an exploration of how a project is created in Node, and the user can check if a poem is a Haiku, or generate a random Haiku._

## Specifications

### Behavior Driven Development

1. First, the user should be able to enter a word and determine the amount of syllables are in the word.

2. Next, a user should be able to enter three lines of words, and be notified whether or not it is a Haiku.

3. After the previous behavior is functional, the user should then be able to press a button that will generate a random Haiku.
